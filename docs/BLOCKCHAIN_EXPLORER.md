## Usage

### Accessing the Explorer
Navigate to `/explorer` in the web application to access the blockchain explorer.

### Viewing Transactions
1. Go to the **Transactions** tab
2. Browse the paginated list of transactions
3. Click on any transaction hash to view detailed information
4. Use pagination controls to navigate through transaction history

### Viewing Blocks
1. Go to the **Blocks** tab
2. Browse the paginated list of blocks
3. View block details including proposer and transaction count
4. Use pagination controls to navigate through block history

### Searching
1. Use the search bar at the top of the explorer
2. Enter a transaction hash (64 character hex string) or block height (number)
3. Press Enter or click the Search button
4. View the results in the appropriate tab

## Technical Details

### Frontend Components
- **`/web/src/app/explorer/page.tsx`**: Main explorer page with tabs for overview, transactions, and blocks
- **`/web/src/app/explorer/tx/[hash]/page.tsx`**: Detailed transaction view page

### API Routes
- **`/web/src/app/api/explorer/stats/route.ts`**: Blockchain statistics endpoint
- **`/web/src/app/api/explorer/transactions/route.ts`**: Transaction list endpoint
- **`/web/src/app/api/explorer/transaction/[hash]/route.ts`**: Single transaction details endpoint
- **`/web/src/app/api/explorer/blocks/route.ts`**: Block list endpoint

### Data Sources
The explorer connects to:
- **Cosmos REST API** (default: `http://localhost:1317`) - For transaction and validator data
- **Tendermint RPC** (default: `http://localhost:26657`) - For block and status data

### Environment Variables
Configure the following in your `.env` or docker-compose:
```bash
BLOCKCHAIN_API=http://localhost:1317
BLOCKCHAIN_NODE=http://localhost:26657
```

## UI Components Used
- **shadcn/ui**: Card, Table, Badge, Button, Input, Tabs, Separator
- **Lucide Icons**: Activity, Box, Hash, CheckCircle2, XCircle, etc.
- **date-fns**: For timestamp formatting

## Features in Development
- [ ] Advanced filtering (by message type, status, date range)
- [ ] Validator details page
- [ ] Network statistics graphs
- [ ] Export transaction data
- [ ] WebSocket support for real-time updates
- [ ] Account/address explorer

## Performance Considerations
- Pagination limits results to 20 items per page by default
- Auto-refresh interval set to 10 seconds to balance freshness with API load
- Transaction hashes and addresses are truncated for better UI display
- Lazy loading of detailed transaction data

## Browser Support
The explorer is built with modern web technologies and supports:
- Chrome/Edge (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)

## Contributing
When adding new features to the explorer:
1. Follow the existing component structure
2. Use TypeScript for type safety
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Add loading states for async operations
5. Ensure mobile responsiveness
6. Update this documentation
