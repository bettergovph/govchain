# GovChain Blockchain

A tokenless, public good blockchain for government data transparency and accountability.

## 🎯 Mission

GovChain is a decentralized blockchain network designed to store and manage government datasets with complete transparency. Our mission is to create an open, accessible platform where government data can be stored immutably and accessed by all citizens.

## 🌟 Key Features

### Tokenless Architecture
- **No Economic Barriers**: Anyone can participate without purchasing tokens
- **Volunteer-Operated**: Community-driven validator network
- **Public Good Focus**: Designed for transparency, not profit

### Government Data Management
- **Immutable Records**: Government datasets stored permanently on blockchain
- **IPFS Integration**: Efficient file storage with content addressing
- **Rich Metadata**: Comprehensive dataset information and categorization
- **Query Capabilities**: Search by agency, category, and file type

### Decentralized Network
- **Cosmos SDK**: Built on proven blockchain technology
- **Validator Network**: Volunteer nodes secure the network
- **Consensus Driven**: Community governance model
- **Open Source**: Fully transparent and auditable code

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Blockchain Components
- **Datasets Module**: Custom Cosmos SDK module for data management
- **Entry Storage**: Structured metadata for government files
- **Query Engine**: Efficient data retrieval and filtering
- **Validator Network**: Decentralized consensus mechanism

### Data Flow
1. **Upload**: Government agencies upload datasets to IPFS
2. **Metadata**: Blockchain stores immutable metadata and references
3. **Validation**: Network validates data integrity and authenticity
4. **Access**: Public can query and download datasets freely

## 🚀 Getting Started

### For Node Operators
See [GETTING_STARTED.md](./GETTING_STARTED.md) for detailed setup instructions.

### Quick Setup
```bash
# Setup blockchain environment
./setup-env.sh

# Start the blockchain
ignite chain serve

# Upload a dataset
./scripts/upload-dataset.sh <file> <title> <description> <agency> <category>
```

### For Volunteer Validators
```bash
# Join the network
./join-as-volunteer.sh <node-name> <genesis-url>

# Start your validator node
./build/govchaind start
```

## 📊 Network Statistics

- **Consensus**: Tendermint BFT
- **Block Time**: ~5 seconds
- **Validators**: Community volunteers
- **Storage**: IPFS for files, blockchain for metadata
- **Governance**: Validator consensus + community input

## 🛡️ Security

### Data Integrity
- **Cryptographic Hashing**: SHA-256 checksums for all files
- **IPFS Content Addressing**: Immutable content identification
- **Blockchain Immutability**: Tamper-proof metadata storage

### Network Security
- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: Tendermint consensus mechanism
- **Validator Diversity**: Geographically distributed volunteer nodes
- **Open Source Auditing**: Transparent codebase for security review

## 🌍 Public Impact

### Transparency Benefits
- **Open Government**: All datasets publicly accessible
